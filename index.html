                At <b>The Coffee Haven</b>, we believe coffee is more than just a drink—it’s a way of life, a comfort, and a ritual. Our journey started with a simple love for coffee and the desire to create a space where people could share in that passion.
            </p>
            <h3><b>How It All Began</b></h3>
            <p>
                Our founder, Shada, started with a small coffee cart in Yanbu, serving cups of freshly brewed coffee to early risers and curious passersby. The idea was simple: bring high-quality, ethically sourced coffee to the local community. It didn’t take long before word spread, and soon, we opened our first café, where people could come not only to enjoy their favorite brew but also connect with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The café quickly became more than just a place to grab a coffee—it became a community hub where friendships were made, ideas were shared, and moments were savored. Inspired by our growing family of customers, we decided to take The Coffee Haven online so that more people could enjoy our coffee, no matter where they were.
